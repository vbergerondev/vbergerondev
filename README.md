### Hi there, I'm Vincent 👋

I'm a 26 y/o father of 2, writing PHP for over a decade and writing Laravel apps since 2017 and loving every moment of it ❤️

- ⌨️ I’m currently working on [Zmartests.com](https://zmartests.com/en/) at my day job
- 🛠️ I'm in the process of [rebuilding my personal website](https://github.com/vbergerondev/vbergerondev-laravel) using Laravel instead of Tighten's Jigsaw
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on more open source projects and hopefully get some PRs merged by the end of 2025 💪
- 💡 Open to collaborations on side projects! If you have an idea and want to team up, let me know
- 💬 Ask me about anything Laravel, Vue.js, Livewire or PHP related
- 📫 How to reach me: hello@vbergeron.dev or Twitter DM
